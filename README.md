Hello, I'm Linus Yohanna

I'm building towards smart contract development with focus on security.
My current work centers on learning Solidity fundamentals, understanding Smart Contract Vulnerabilities and writing clear, documented code

What I'm working towards:
- Solidity basics and EVM concenpts
- Writing simple smart contract
- Studying common smart contract vulnerabilities

Work Focus
- To build small, focused projects
- To document what I learn and what breaks
- To prioritize correction and clarity over speed

MY BIG GOAL:
To become a reliable Smart Contract Developer with a strong Secutiy mindset
